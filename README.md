# dotfiles

### timeline

This all started (_2017_) as typical dotfiles, a place to store configuation files with a few shell scripts included.

In addition to the usual collection of configuration files, startup scripts, etc.,
this repo is became (_2021_) a personal Python monorepo.

In the winter of this year (_2025_), these files are being revisited, at least for their original purpose of configuration.
