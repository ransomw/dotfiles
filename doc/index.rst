`screen`
-----

Used `tmux`, mostly (cf. rant in `readme.md`)
and dithering with GNU terminal multiplexing
lately.
Ergonomic defaults (to/from the typist) are the
main sell for me thus far.

.. include:screen
   :index:



`vim`

`vim` includes a lot of `perl`
> no breaking changes in .. maaany years

i'll either become better at it than emacs
ooor insist on plain `vi`

for now,

**config-like cmds**

are
* `:set tabstop=3` or 4
   s'th < 8, the default.
* `:set nohls` (after
  `less`-like '/' and '?'
  fwd n bkwd search)

... usage of `vim`
in the near term
for me
will likely depend on whether settings, available functions, etc.,
can be managed with a Python
(rather than a Perl -- or even Lua)
module.  reasoning:
**homoiconicity** makes it easy
to slice 'n dice [e]Lisp,
even if i'm not writing
in it on the daily, so I can manage
emacs configuration -- or at least
go without a ton of gglin' -- without
much cognitive overhead.  meanwhile,
i'm oft-obliged to write in one or
more
[OO|proc|proceedural|loosly-typed|interpreted|...]
languages for the Bread, Cheese,
    and, _crud_!, I've lentils to wash.
 none of these are great reasons.
 vim rox, emacs 's cool.
